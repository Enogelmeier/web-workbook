      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am from West Texas and have been moving all over the state for most of my life. I've lived outside the US for a year but Texas sucked me back here!</p>
      <p>I have a diverse background educationally and professionally. I have a degree in Biology and in Spanish. I've worked as a bartender, research assistant in a Chemistry lab, and a sales rep for a tech company</p>
      <p>I love traveling and learning, and I take great joy in experiencing new things. Maybe help me find a job abroad?</p>

      <h3>Why I am Learning how to Code</h3>
      <p>I started to do some easy projects last summer with my cousin's website. I loved it and keep learning more. One day I woke up early before work and was making changes to her site, when I realized I'd rather do that than my job.</p>
      <p>I genuinely enjoy watching any code turn into something fully functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
      <p>One day I will be a digital nomad, my laptop my floating office.</p>
